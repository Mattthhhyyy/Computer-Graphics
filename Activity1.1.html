    <h1>Fitness for All: Discover the Joy of Movement, No Matter Your Starting Point</h1>

    <br>

            Many people strive to be fit. Fitness, after all, is synonymous with health.
            Having a high level of overall fitness is linked with a lower risk of chronic disease, as well as a better ability to manage health issues that do come up. Better fitness also promotes more functionality and mobility throughout one’s life span.
            And in the short term, being active can help your day-to-day functioning, from better mood to sharper focus to better sleep.
    </p>
    <p>&emsp;
        Simply put: Our bodies are meant to move, and they tend to function better when we’re more fit.
        That said, it’s also important to know that there are many different ways to be fit (think of a ballet dancer versus a bodybuilder or a sprinter versus a gymnast). And fitness does not have a singular “look.” In fact, appearance can’t necessarily tell you about someone’s habits, whether they’re actually physically active, or even whether they’re fit at all.
    </p>

    <h1>What It Means to Be Fit</h1>
    <br>
    <img src= "Activity1.1/images/featured-gym-1152x768.jpg" alt="fitness_1.jpg">
    <br><br>
    <p>&emsp;
    According to the <a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf">Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</a> set forth by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), there are five components of physical fitness:
    </p>

     <p>
                    <li>
                      Cardiorespiratory Fitness. Your VO2 max is a commonly used measure of this. It’s your body’s ability to uptake and utilize oxygen (which feeds all of your tissues), something that is directly related to your health and quality of life, says Abbie Smith-Ryan, PhD, professor and director of the Applied Physiology Laboratory at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
                    </li>
    </p>

    <p>   
                    <li>
                    Musculoskeletal Fitness. This includes muscle strength, endurance, and power.
                    </li>
    </p>

     <p>   
                    <li>
                    Flexibility This is the range of motion of your joints.
                    
                    </li>
    </p>

    <p>   
                    <li>
                    Balance This is your ability to stay on your feet and steady to avoid falls.
                    </li>
    </p>

    <p>   
                    <li>
                    Speed This is how quickly you can move.
                    </li>
    </p>

    <p>
        A frequently cited peer-reviewed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1424733/">research paper</a> from 1985 defined the difference between the terms “physical activity” (bodily movement resulting in energy expenditure), “exercise” (planned and structured physical activity), and “physical fitness.” The paper defined physical fitness as a set of attributes that people have or achieve that determines their ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and alertness, without undue fatigue. Cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance, muscular strength, body composition, and flexibility are components that can be used to measure fitness, also according to that paper. 
    </p>

    <p>
     In the real world, fitness translates to function, says Dr. Smith-Ryan. For example, can you carry your groceries or walk up the stairs without getting winded? Can you run around the backyard with your kids? Can you climb the stairs?
    </p>

    <p>
     Exercise is distinct from fitness because exercise is what you do to improve your fitness.

    <h1>Growing Obesity Rate</h1>
    <br>
    <img src= "Activity1.1/images/shutterstock_3.jpg" alt="Obesity.jpg">
    <p>&emsp;
    According to <a href="https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-ph/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-obesity/in-obesity?questionid=g64sa53m&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna">Dr. Anuvitha Kamath</a> the diseases caused by or associated with obesity are increased blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, heart problems, high cholesterol levels leading to dyslipidemia, stroke, gall bladder disease, breathing problems, and sleep apnea.
    It can also cause polycystic ovarian disease in females, generalized tiredness and weakness, osteoarthritis- degeneration of cartilage, and body pain.
    <br><br>
    Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. The issue has grown to epidemic proportions, with over 4 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017 according to the global burden of disease. 
    <br><br>
    Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and children. From 1975 to 2016, the prevalence of overweight or obese children and adolescents aged 5–19 years increased more than four-fold from 4% to 18% globally.
    <br><br>
    Obesity is one side of the double burden of malnutrition, and today more people are obese than underweight in every region except sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Once considered a problem only in high-income countries, overweight and obesity are now dramatically on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. The vast majority of overweight or obese children live in developing countries, where the rate of increase has been more than 30% higher than that of developed countries
    <br><br>
    
    <h1>How Much Exercise Do You Need?</h1>
    <p>
        The amount of exercise recommended for each age range varies depending on various factors, including age itself, physical health, and overall activity level. Here's a breakdown of general guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
    </p>

    <h2>Children and adolescents (6-17 years)</h2>

    <p>
        <li>At least 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity daily. This can include activities like brisk walking, running, biking, swimming, dancing, sports, or active games.
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>Include activities that strengthen muscles at least 3 days a week. This could be push-ups, sit-ups, weightlifting, or other exercises that work all major muscle groups.
    </p>

    <h2>Adults (18-64 years)</h2>

    <p>
        <li>At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week. Moderate-intensity activities make you talk in short sentences but not sing. Examples include brisk walking, biking, swimming, or dancing. Vigorous activities make it hard to talk. Examples include running, jumping rope, or HIIT workouts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>Muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms) on 2 or more days a week.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Older adults (65 years and older)</h2>

    <p>
        <li>Same recommendations as adults (18-64 years). However, it's crucial to focus on activities that improve balance and flexibility, in addition to aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercises.
    </p>
    
    <img src= "Activity1.1/images/Health.webp" alt="Workout.jpg">

    <h1>Workout Plan For All Ages and Fitness Levels</h1>

    <p>
        This plan offers several cardio and HIIT options you can progress through as you gain strength and endurance. Choose activities you enjoy and adjust intensity based on your comfort. Always aim for a warm-up before and cool-down after each session.
    </p>
    <h2>Warm-up (5-10 minutes):</h2>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        HIIT (medium intensity): Alternate 30 seconds of running/sprint with 30 seconds of walking for 15-20 minutes.
    </li>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>

        Increase duration by 5-10 minutes every 2-3 weeks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Increase intensity by choosing a more challenging activity, increasing pace, resistance, or incline.

    </li>
    <li>
        Increase HIIT interval duration or decrease rest periods as you get fitter.
    </li>

    <h2></h2>
    <h1>The Bottom Line</h1>

    <p>
        Fitness isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. Find activities you enjoy and tailor your workout to your goals and needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fitness is more than just physical health. It boosts energy, mood, and overall well-being, impacting every aspect of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fitness isn't just about the gym. Find your joy in movement, nourish your body, and embrace a vibrant life.
